TW5-Respawn
======================

This plugin will prevent an *empty story-river experience* by
respawning all default (home) tiddlers once the river is empty, i.e.
all tiddlers have been closed.

This plugin makes most sense if the wiki is used as website to avoid
that the user is confronted with an empty page.
